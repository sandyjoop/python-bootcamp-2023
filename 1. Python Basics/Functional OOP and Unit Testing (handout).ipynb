    "## Functional Programming: \n",
    " - Using functions to group code blocks\n",
    " - Think of functional programming like cooking with separate ingredients. You have recipes (functions) that take specific ingredients (data) and give you tasty dishes (results). These recipes don't change the ingredients, and they don't mess up your kitchen. They're like magic spells that transform things without any mess.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object-Oriented Programming:\n",
    "- Using class to group code blocks\n",
    "- Imagine you're building a virtual world with different characters (objects). Each character has its own unique looks (attributes) and actions (methods). You design a blueprint (class) for creating these characters, so you can make as many as you want. Even if characters are different, they follow the same rules and can do similar things.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, functional programming is about using functions to transform data without messing it up, while object-oriented programming is like creating and controlling different characters in a well-organized way. And in Python, you can mix and match these approaches to create powerful and flexible programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are on a project, you will see people using have different preferences for the programming styles. But it is good to know them all!"
